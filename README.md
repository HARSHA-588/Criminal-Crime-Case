# Criminal-Crime-Case

I designed and developed the comprehensive Criminal Crime Case (CCC) database, tailored to emulate real-life crime scenarios in Andhra Pradesh. The architecture of this database was meticulously planned, incorporating crucial elements like Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams and SQL queries for efficient data manipulation and retrieval. To ensure the database's integrity and performance, I employed a thorough normalization process, further enhancing its reliability and speed.
